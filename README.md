# Covid-19 Data Exploration Project using SQL Server and Tableau Desktop

This project is based on the Covid project presented by Alex Freberg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst

**This project is designed to highlight my following SQL skills:**
* Order of Query Execution
* Manipulating Datasets with NULLs
* Multi-Table Queries with JOINs
* Queries with Mathematical Expressions
* Convert Data Types
* Aggregate Functions
* Window Functions
* Common Table Expressions
* Create Temporary Tables
* Create Views

**This project also highlights my following Tableau skills:**
* Connect SQL Server to Tableau Desktop
* Use Custom SQL Queries 
* Insert CTE via Initial Query
* Build and Beautify Visualizations
* Create Forecasts
* Create Dashboard
* Extract data from SQL Queries to be used on Tableau Public

**Main Steps:**
1. Download dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
2. Upload CSV into Excel, explore, and split dataset into two separate Excel files
3. Import Excel files as 2 tables into SSMS (CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations)
4. Explore data in various ways (see code below) in order to prepare for future Tableau visualizations
5. Import custom SQL queries into Tableau and create visualizations
6. Create and publish dashboard on Tableau Public
